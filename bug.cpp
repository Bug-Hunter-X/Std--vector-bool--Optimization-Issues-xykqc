std::vector<bool> is a special case in the C++ Standard Template Library (STL). While it behaves like a vector of booleans, it doesn't store each boolean value as a single byte. Instead, it uses a bitset for storage, which can lead to performance issues and unexpected behavior compared to other vector types.  For example, accessing an element using the [] operator is slower than for other vectors because it involves bit manipulation to extract the boolean value from the bitset. Also, iterators for std::vector<bool> don't fulfill all the requirements of random-access iterators, leading to potential compatibility issues with algorithms expecting full random access.
